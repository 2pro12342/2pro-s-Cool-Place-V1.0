# About 
A gaming website just like Mohave Info but you can use it on a file. Some games don't work or don't support WebGL. The games that don't work are: Monkey Mart, Funny Shooter 2, Bob the Robber 2, btd 5, WHG 2, SM 64, Super Mario Bros NES, and 1v1.lol Old Version. I currently don't have a website to upload my project in.

## Dowloading Help 
When downloaded click on the app folder > index.html. 

## File Info 
After a while (2 days to 2 weeks), it says your file cannot be accessed. That mean your file either got corrupted or blocked. Delete the Zip file then redownload the 
file on github or gmail. (NOTE: Please read the games that don't work before redownload, because that might be the problem.)
